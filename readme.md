# 🗄️ Database Management Systems (DBMS)

Welcome to my **DBMS Learning Repository**!  
This repository is dedicated to documenting my complete journey of learning **Database Management Systems** — from basic concepts to advanced topics, including notes, examples, SQL scripts, and interview prep materials.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repo will serve as a **personal knowledge base** and a **structured reference** for DBMS concepts.  
Currently, it’s a **work in progress** — I’ll be adding content gradually as I study and practice.

Stay tuned for updates — every commit will represent one more step toward mastering DBMS!
